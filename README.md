Acknowledgments

This project is possible because of the generosity, creativity, and expertise of several contributors who shared their work or granted permission for modification and redistribution.

• Kevin Berry (Purdue University)
Kevin Berry deserves special recognition for his extensive modifications to both the head and ear models. His technical skill, artistic insight, and creative problem-solving transformed the raw anatomical models into the finalized AUDIO-MAN components. His contributions represent the majority of the design work for the 3D-printed head and ear structures and are essential to the success of this project.

• Adam Gevaert
Acknowledged for granting permission to modify and redistribute his 3D human head model, which forms the basis of the AUDIO-MAN manikin’s cranial structure.

• Dr. Hong Zhao and Dr. Daniel Coelho (Virginia Commonwealth University)
Gratefully acknowledged for their permission to use, modify, and redistribute their 3D ear canal and pinna model.
